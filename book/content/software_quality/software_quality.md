# Software Quality Checklist

## Summary
Here we provide a short checklist for software projects, the rest of this chapter elaborates on the various point in this list.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful
> why we think you should read the whole thing

## Chapter content

The __bare minimum__ that every software project should do, from the start, is:
* [FIX_LINK] Pick & include an [open source license]()
* Use [version control](/version_control/version_control)
* Use a [publicly accessible](/open_research/02/opensourcesoftware)
 version control repository
* [FIX_LINK] Add [documentation describing the project]()


We recommend that you also do the following (from the start of the project):
* Use [code quality tools](/code_quality/code_quality)
* [Testing](/testing/testing)


Additional steps depend on the goal of the software (zero or more can apply):
* [I'm publishing a paper](#im-publishing-a-paper)
* [I'm expecting users](#im-expecting-users)
* [I'm expecting contributors](#im-expecting-contributors)

## I'm publishing a paper

* [Make your software citable](../citable_software/making_software_citable.html)
* Add a [CITATION.cff file](documentation.html#software-citation)
* Cite DOI in paper


## I'm expecting users

* [Release](releases.html) your software
* Provide [user documentation](documentation.html)
* [Easy installation](releases.html#one-command-install)
* Provide issue tracker


## I'm expecting contributors

* Provide [development documentation](documentation.html#source-code-documentation)
* Provide a [means of communication](communication.html#discussion-list)
* Implement and add a [code of conduct](documentation.html#code-of-conduct)
* [Contribution guideline](documentation.html#contribution-guidelines)
